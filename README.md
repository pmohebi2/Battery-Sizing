# Battery-Sizing
Our objective is to determine the optimal battery capacity in a grid-connected PV-battery system. The code is organized into several components, all integrated through the  main script. To execute the program, simply run the main fileâ€”it automatically calls the necessary modules. The only variable module is the input, which can be adjusted as needed. This module includes battery features, Time of use, and Net load data (data.csv) for the year, including 8760 hours. The optimization process leverages the Pyomo library, and the results are saved and visualized in the output file.
